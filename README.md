# diversity-epistemic-networks
WIP. 
Python code for modelling the effects of diversity in epistemic networks

This project requires Python 3.11.

# Installation
(1) clone this repository

(2) 
```
cd diversity-epistemic-networks
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate epistemic-networks
```

# Running the code
If you want to run the lifecycle simulations, do
```
conda activate epistemic-networks
python diversity.py
```

In addition, `zollman.py` reproduces results from Zollman 2007, and `polarization.py` reproduces some results from O'Connor and Weatherall 2018.
